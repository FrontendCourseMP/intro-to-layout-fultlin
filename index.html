            Our Story and Mission
          </h2>

          <p>
            We explored various aspects of cryptocurrencies, including using Bitcoin for payments, mining, and trading with different strategies. 
            We also considered starting a company and extensively researched Ethereum and smart contracts. However, we struggled to find a viable business model. 
            Concerns about government intervention and the potential ban of Bitcoin always lingered. 
            As a result, we pursued other entrepreneurial ventures and found some validation when the ICO wave ended with a crash. 
            The positive developments in 2020 took us by surprise. The influx of capital from established institutions, including the financial industry, made it increasingly challenging for the government to ban Bitcoin. 
            However, we acknowledge that they may still attempt to do so. Recently, when we attempted to transfer our old, now more valuable Bitcoin and Ether to a new wallet, we discovered that 
            we had lost access to them completely. We were unable to locate our wallets in the first place.
